Various tips for using this plugin

* URL format

  You must use a scm url format:

+----------------+
  scm:<scm_provider><delimiter><provider_specific_part>
+----------------+

  Example for svn: <<<scm:svn:https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maven/content/plugins/maven-scm-publish-plugin/>>>

  And configure is as it:

+----------------+
  <distributionManagement>
    <site>
      <id>site_id</id>
      <url>scm:svn:https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maven/content/plugins/maven-scm-publish-plugin/</url>
    </site>
  </distributionManagement>
+----------------+

  <<NOTE>>: with svn, if the remote url doesn't exist, it will be created.

* Git branch

  To use Git branch (for example: {{{https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/}GitHub <<<gh-pages>>>}})

+----------------+
  <distributionManagement>
    <site>
      <id>site_id</id>
      <url>${project.scm.developerConnection}</url><!-- or scm:git:ssh://git@github.com/username/tomcat-foo-artifact.git -->
    </site>
  </distributionManagement>
...
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-scm-publish-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <scmBranch>gh-pages</scmBranch>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
+----------------+

  <<Initial creation of the branch has to be done manually>>, as a Git orphan branch:

  1. <<<git checkout --orphan gh-pages>>> to create the branch locally,

  2. <<<rm .git/index ; git clean -fdx>>> to clean the branch content and let it empy,

  3. copy an initial site content,

  4. commit and push: <<<git add *>>>, <<<git commit -m "initial site content">>>, <<<git push>>>

* Improving SCM Checkout Performance

  By default, a complete checkout is done. You can configure the plugin to try update rather than a full checkout/clone

+----------------+
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-scm-publish-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <tryUpdate>true</tryUpdate>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
+----------------+

  By default, the scm content is checked-out/cloned to <<<$\{project.build.directory}/scmpublish-checkout>>>, so when running <<<mvn clean>>>,
  all the content is deleted. You can configure a path to your machine to avoid full checkout.
  A recommended way is to use a property with a default value that your colleague will be able to override in their settings.

+----------------+
    <properties>
      ...
      <!-- override in your settings -->
      <siteMainDirectory>${user.home}</siteMainDirectory>
      <scmPubCheckoutDirectory>\${siteMainDirectory}/my-site-content-scm</scmPubCheckoutDirectory>
      ...
    </properties>

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-scm-publish-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>${project.version}</version>
      <configuration>
        <checkoutDirectory>${scmPubCheckoutDirectory}</checkoutDirectory>
        <tryUpdate>true</tryUpdate>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
